## Structure

Each folder maps to a project I've created while studying in my free time. Internal `README` files should have links to articles and resources.

## Method

It's a bit boring at times, but I prefer to re-write all the code from scratch by myself, while making my own adjustments. Source won't be 1-1 to articles and docs might be lacking, as I tend to only add comments for things that _I_ believe require clarification.

Python projects will use `pipenv` is the tool of choice for dependencies, with `flake8` and `black` getting triggered throught `pipenv run` or my IDE (vscode). Other languages will just follow whatever guidelines I find in the articles/videos/books. Also don't mind the stupid jokes and occasional rants as comments - I just can't help it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Band Recommendation

[Lycia](https://lycia.bandcamp.com/album/cold) is not only a band of choice for studying, but one of my favorite bands from all time.
