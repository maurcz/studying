## Structure

Each folder maps to a project I've created while studying in my free time. Internal `README` files should have links to articles and resources.

## Method

It's a bit boring at times, but I prefer to re-write all the code from scratch by myself, while making my own adjustments. Source won't be 1-1 to articles and docs might be lacking, as I tend to only add comments for things that _I_ believe require clarification.

## Band Recommendation

[Lycia](https://lycia.bandcamp.com/album/cold) is not only a band of choice for studying, but one of my favorite bands from all time.
