# k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Guide from Real Python: https://realpython.com/knn-python/

## Running

Jupyter notebook, `ipykernel` required.

## Map

- Builds a simple knn prediction from scratch, then uses `scikit-learn`.

- Creating the model with `scikit-learn` is super simple, but proper tunning is crucial to create better results.

_(I still struggle with plotting, maybe that should be the focus for future studying sessions?...)_
